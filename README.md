# [MAIN3] The Resistance
'The Resistance' is a board game relying on secret identities, deception and lie. It consists in rebels trying to overpower the empire by accomplishing missions and spies hidden in their ranks that try and make them fail.

This is a digitalization of the original board game for the Operating Systems course.
The goal is to see how we can use network programmation, client/server architecture and multithreads applications to re-create the game with some minimal graphic interface using GTK.
